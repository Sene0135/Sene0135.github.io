			  	<p class=P2> Danny and Isaac were two young boys who were taken into Wasantha's care when they were just four years old. Prior to this, they had been homeschooled, so it took them a few weeks to adjust to their new environment. However, with the caring and nurturing guidance of Wasantha and her team, the boys were able to settle in and become comfortable in their new surroundings. As they began to adapt to their new routine, Danny and Isaac quickly developed strong friendships with the other children in Ms. Wasantha's care. They were grateful for the love and support they received, and felt like they were part of a big family.</p>
